# Node-Redis

- **Sequential Processing:** Tasks are processed one by one in the order they were enqueued.
- **Customizable:** You can define how tasks are processed and handle task completion.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the JavaScript Queuing System, you need to include the `queue.js` file in your project.

You can either download the `queue.js` file manually from this repository or install it using npm:

```bash
npm install my-js-queue
```

### Usage

1. Import or include the `queue.js` file in your JavaScript project.

```javascript
const Queue = require('./queue'); // Adjust the path accordingly
```

2. Create a new instance of the queue.

```javascript
const taskQueue = new Queue();
```

3. Add tasks to the queue using the `enqueue` method.

```javascript
taskQueue.enqueue(task1);
taskQueue.enqueue(task2);
// ... add more tasks
```

4. Start processing tasks using the `process` method.

```javascript
taskQueue.process(task => {
  // Process the task here
  // For example: task();
});
```

## API

## Introduction

This JavaScript Queuing System is designed to help you manage tasks in a queue structure.
It allows you to add tasks to the queue and process them in a sequential manner. This can
be particularly useful for scenarios where you need to control the order of task execution,
such as asynchronous operations or task processing pipelines.

## Features
